## What does **zero waste** mean to me?

I believe that **zero waste** is just a term. I cannot imagine my own life with no trash... But **zero waste** is not only about the physical trash, there are so many aspects to an environmentally sustainable lifestyle. 

My personal aim is to eliminate single-use plastic from my life. I still eat animal products from time to time and I travel frequently by air plane. 

In my opinion, the most important thing is to raise awareness. People should be more conscious about the consequences of their daily decisions.

For example,
##### have you ever thought about where your cigarette butts will end up; 
##### do you know that the green dot - Der Grüne Punkt - on packaging means only that the manufacturer of the product contributes to the cost of recovery and recycling or 
##### are you aware of that in Ireland coffee cups are not recyclable...???
