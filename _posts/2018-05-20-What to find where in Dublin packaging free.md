Hey hey!

I have been planning this post for AGES. This week, I had my last exam ever (lol... I do not even believe myself on this topic anymore ;) So now finally I have "more" me-time.
Though I still have a PhD to finish this summer... But I will try to do my best to have blog posts coming more often.

I hope this post will help some of the local Dubliners on their zero waste journey to know where to find what packaging free in Dublin and surrounding areas.

There are 5 main places (I am aware of) where you can have dried goods straight into your own container (cloth bag, jar, plastic Chinese box...).

**Pop-up stalls**

BN - [Bare Necessities](https://www.facebook.com/BareNecessitiesIreland/)

BYO - [Bring Your Own](https://www.facebook.com/bringyourowncontainers/)

MWG - [Minimal Waste Grocery](https://minimalwastegrocery.com/)

**Organic whole food stores selling products package free**

DFC - [Dublin Food Coop](https://www.dublinfood.coop/)

SC - [Small Changes](https://www.smallchanges.ie/)

I sourced data from the websites/facebook sites of the stalls/stores, except of the DFC, they do not have their list online, so it is based on what was available in their store at the beginning of May.
